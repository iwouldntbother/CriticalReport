Netflix
’
s
approach
to

is
indic
ative
of
a
broader
trend
in
the
industry
,
where
companies
leverage
big
data
to
inform

making
processes

By

This

is
not

beneficial
for

also
plays
a
crucial
role
in
operational

Net

use
of

extends
beyond

.
These
technologies
are
also
employed
in
areas
such
as
customer

,
where
chat

ensuring
that

This

The

we
can

particularly
through
the

This

involves
