software
in

design
.
In
the
context
of
AI
,
util
ities
could
refer
to
data
pre
processing
scripts
,
model
training
schedul
ers
,
or
performance
bench
mark
ing
tools
.
The
key
difference
between
tools
and
util
ities
lies
in
their
primary
function
.
Tools
are
directly
involved
in
the
creation
and
manip
ulation
of
designs
,
while
util
ities
support
these
processes
by
improving
efficiency
,
organization
,
and
work
flow
.
However
,
the
distinction
is
not
always
clear
-
cut
,
as
some
software
or
features
can
function
as
both
a
tool
and
a
utility
depending
on
how
they
are
used
.
In
the
rapidly
ev
olving
field
of
AI
-
ass
isted
graphic
design
,
tools
and
util
ities
are
becoming
increasingly
integrated
.
AI
tools
can
generate
designs
based
on
user
input
,
while
AI
util
ities
can
autom
ate
repet
itive
tasks
,
organize
design
elements
,
and
even
provide
suggestions
to
improve
designs
.
This
integration
of
tools
and
util
ities
is
transform
ing
the
graphic
design
process
,
enabling
designers
to
focus
more
on
creativity
and
less
on
manual
tasks
.

Through

,
AI
has
left
an
ind

mark
on
graphic

practices
worldwide
.
Hist
or
ically
,
AI
began
its
influence
on
graphic
design
by
addressing
m

ane
tasks
that
consumed
designers
'
time
and
energy
.
Task
s
such
as
image
res

,
color

,
and
font

were
stream
lined
through
the
implementation
of
machine

However
,
AI

It
has
evolved
into
a

This

has
resulted
in

and
has

Des

AI
'

role
in

is
not

There
are
concerns
about

However
,
the

By

Through
