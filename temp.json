From aiding in decision-making processes to revolutionising industries such as healthcare and finance, AI's capabilities seem boundless. In the realm of design and utilities, AI has emerged as a powerful tool, streamlining processes and enhancing creativity. However, as we delve deeper into the implications of AI integration, questions regarding its ethical dimensions arise. Should AI within tools and utilities, design or otherwise, have morality or censorship? This research report aims to explore this contentious issue by examining the current landscape of AI in design and utilities, discussing the concepts of morality and censorship in the context of AI, and analysing the pros and cons of implementing these principles. Ultimately, this report will offer insights into the ethical considerations surrounding AI integration and provide a personal perspective on the matter."

These LLMs operate by predicting the next word in a sentence, leveraging contextual understanding and specialisation for specific topics or use cases. However, they typically necessitate skilful prompting, potentially yielding subpar results when integrated into public applications, thus perceived as a fallback option. While this limitation may not pose significant issues in note-taking scenarios, extrapolating this trend suggests a plausible future where such models could find implementation in more critical infrastructures, raising concerns about reliability and ethical considerations."
