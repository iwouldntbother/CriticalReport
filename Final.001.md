## Introduction (~500)

In an era dominated by technological advancements, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various aspects of our lives has become increasingly prevalent. From aiding in decision-making processes to revolutionising industries such as healthcare and finance, AI's capabilities seem boundless. In the realm of design and utilities, AI has emerged as a powerful tool, streamlining processes and enhancing creativity. However, as I investigate further into the implications of AI integration, questions regarding its ethical dimensions arise. Should AI within tools and utilities, design or otherwise, have morality or censorship? This research report aims to explore this contentious issue by examining the current landscape of AI in design and utilities, discussing the concepts of morality and censorship in the context of AI, and analysing the pros and cons of implementing these principles. Ultimately, this report will offer insights into the ethical considerations surrounding AI integration and provide a personal perspective on the matter.

Discussions on the moral and ethical implications of AI frequently highlight the potential for misuse by nefarious actors, emphasizing concerns about exploitation for harmful purposes. While this issue is undoubtedly significant, there's another, less commonly addressed concern regarding the widespread reliance on AI features across various services. Statistical data, such as that presented in Stanford University's AI Index annual report of 2021, underscores the prevalence of conversations surrounding AI ethics, indicating a growing recognition of its importance. The report shows a steady rise in the number of papers with ethics-related keywords in their titles submitted to AI conferences since 2015, reflecting an increasing focus on the ethical challenges of AI applications.

Personally, AI, particularly machine learning, holds a profound interest in my life. I've observed a notable trend in many services offering AI features, particularly in digital and text-based platforms. Notion, a popular note-taking service, is a prime example, integrating AI features often based on large language models (LLMs). These LLMs operate by predicting the next word in a sentence, leveraging contextual understanding and specialisation for specific topics or use cases. However, they typically necessitate skilful prompting, potentially yielding subpar results when integrated into public applications, thus perceived as a fallback option. While this limitation may not pose significant issues in note-taking scenarios, extrapolating this trend suggests a plausible future where such models could find implementation in more critical infrastructures, raising concerns about reliability and ethical considerations.

(Otal and Canbaz, 2024) highlight a critical concern in the integration of LLMs into emergency response systems, emphasising the risk of AI systems perpetuating societal biases. They point out that these biases may manifest as slower response times in specific demographic areas or errors in facial recognition technologies. Despite the potential efficiency gains, the authors acknowledge the pressing challenges associated with deploying AI models in crucial systems. This underscores the importance of further exploring and addressing these issues to ensure equitable and effective emergency response mechanisms.

## Tool vs. Utility

In the context of AI and graphic design, the terms "tools" and "utilities" often overlap, but they have distinct connotations.

**Tools** in AI and graphic design refer to software or features within software that enable the creation, modification, and enhancement of designs. They are the primary means by which designers interact with their work. Examples include drawing tools, shape tools, text tools, and color tools in graphic design software. In the context of AI, tools might refer to algorithms, models, or software libraries that allow for tasks such as image recognition, style transfer, or automated design.

On the other hand, **utilities** are supportive features or standalone software that facilitate the design process but are not directly involved in creating the design. They perform auxiliary functions that make the designer's work more efficient or organized. Examples include color pickers, layer managers, file converters, and batch processing software in graphic design. In the context of AI, utilities could refer to data preprocessing scripts, model training schedulers, or performance benchmarking tools.

The key difference between tools and utilities lies in their primary function. Tools are directly involved in the creation and manipulation of designs, while utilities support these processes by improving efficiency, organization, and workflow. However, the distinction is not always clear-cut, as some software or features can function as both a tool and a utility depending on how they are used.

In the rapidly evolving field of AI-assisted graphic design, tools and utilities are becoming increasingly integrated. AI tools can generate designs based on user input, while AI utilities can automate repetitive tasks, organize design elements, and even provide suggestions to improve designs. This integration of tools and utilities is transforming the graphic design process, enabling designers to focus more on creativity and less on manual tasks.

A report by (Denisa, 2023) underscores the importance of AI-driven accessibility enhancements, revealing that inclusive design practices not only improve user satisfaction but also expand the reach of products and services to a broader audience. Thus, AI-driven personalization not only enhances user experience but also fosters inclusivity and accessibility in design.

While the integration of AI tools in graphic design undoubtedly offers numerous advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge that excessive reliance on AI may also pose significant challenges. Thus, while exploring the benefits of AI integration, it is equally important to consider its potential drawbacks.

## Case Studies (~750)

### Netflix case study

Netflix’s innovative use of data analysis tools and graphic design is a cornerstone of their strategy to continuously improve their streaming service. While the specifics of their data collection and usage are proprietary, Netflix has publicly acknowledged the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within their platform. This commitment to technology enables Netflix to offer a highly personalized viewing experience, tailoring content and recommendations to individual preferences.

The Aesthetic Visual Analysis (AVA) database, which was introduced in a paper at the 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, is a comprehensive resource containing over 250,000 images. (Murray, Marchesotti and Perronnin, 2012) Each image in the AVA database is accompanied by a wealth of metadata, including aesthetic scores, semantic labels for more than 60 categories, and connections to various photographic styles. This database serves as a valuable tool for researchers and technologists to analyze and understand visual aesthetics on a large scale.

Netflix’s technology team has developed a similar system for curating artwork for their titles. “by harvesting static image frames directly from our source videos to provide a more flexible source of raw artwork”. (Riley et al., 2018) These images are then analysed to determine which ones are most likely to engage viewers. The process, detailed on the Netflix Tech Blog, mirrors the AVA database’s approach to visual analysis, although Netflix has not explicitly stated they use the AVA database. The similarities in their methodologies highlight the importance of visual data in determining what captures viewers’ attention.

In the realm of content streaming, the significance of data analysis cannot be overstated. Netflix’s approach to data utilization is indicative of a broader trend in the industry, where companies leverage big data to inform decision-making processes. By analysing user behaviour, preferences, and interactions, streaming services can optimize their offerings to better suit their audience’s tastes. This data-driven strategy is not only beneficial for content personalization but also plays a crucial role in operational areas such as network optimization and predictive maintenance.

Netflix’s use of AI and ML extends beyond content recommendations. These technologies are also employed in areas such as customer service, where chatbots and automated systems provide timely assistance to subscribers. Furthermore, AI algorithms assist in content localization, ensuring that subtitles and dubbing are accurately synchronized with the video content. This level of attention to detail is crucial for maintaining a seamless viewing experience for a global audience.

The intersection of AI, ML, and big data is transforming the entertainment industry. Companies like Netflix are at the forefront of this revolution, harnessing the power of technology to deliver content that resonates with viewers around the world. As these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated systems that further enhance the user experience. The future of content streaming is bright, and it is data that will light the way.

Netflix has been at the forefront of using A/B testing to optimize user experience, particularly through the selection of cover images for its content. This method involves presenting different sets of artwork to different segments of their audience and measuring which images drive more engagement. The rationale behind this is rooted in neuroscience findings that humans can process images in as little as 13 milliseconds, making visual cues a significant factor in content selection (Krishnan, 2016).

In one of their experiments, Netflix aimed to identify artwork that not only helped members find content faster but also increased overall engagement without misrepresenting the title. They collaborated with their Creative Services team to create compelling artwork that conveys the emotion of a title in a single image. The challenge was to capture a member’s attention within 90 seconds, the critical window before a user might lose interest (Krishnan, 2016).

Netflix’s A/B testing philosophy is about building incrementally, using data to drive decisions, and failing fast. They conduct rigorous tests with a complex set of hypotheses to continuously improve the member experience (Krishnan, 2016). This approach has led to a personalized user interface where the artwork is not just a static image but a dynamic element tailored to individual preferences, significantly enhancing the platform’s ability to recommend the right titles to the right users (Chandrashekar et al., 2017).

## Critique of AI Overuse (~1000)

The advent of AI in graphic design has undoubtedly ushered in a new era of efficiency and productivity. However, amidst the automation and optimization facilitated by AI, there lies a pressing concern regarding the potential loss of creativity inherent in AI-generated designs. Unlike human designers, AI lacks the nuanced understanding of emotions, context, and cultural subtleties that underpin truly creative and resonant design. While AI algorithms excel at processing data and generating outputs based on predefined parameters, they often struggle to imbue designs with the human touch and emotional depth that characterize truly innovative and impactful creations.

Case studies offer poignant illustrations of instances where AI-generated designs fall short in evoking emotional resonance or originality. For example, Creative Convergence (Hutson et al., 2024) highlights a marketing campaign where AI-generated visuals failed to resonate with the target audience, lacking the creativity and emotional appeal necessary to drive engagement and brand loyalty.

Human creativity and intuition are foundational pillars of graphic design, enabling designers to transcend mere functionality and imbue designs with meaning, emotion, and cultural relevance. By relinquishing creative control to AI algorithms, designers risk diminishing these essential qualities, thereby compromising the authenticity and effectiveness of their work. Moreover, over-reliance on AI-driven design processes may stifle innovation and limit the exploration of unconventional ideas and artistic expression. Thus, while AI can undoubtedly enhance efficiency and streamline workflows, it is imperative to preserve and nurture human creativity as an indispensable component of graphic design practice.

This phenomenon, known as ‘AI washing’, is becoming increasingly prevalent, leading to false AI use claims and raising ethical concerns.

One of the most notable examples of AI washing involves the tech giant Amazon and its “Just Walk Out” technology. This technology, which uses computer vision, sensors, and AI, allows shoppers at Amazon Fresh stores to pick up items and leave the store without going through a traditional checkout process. The technology is supposed to monitor the shoppers and calculate their purchases, charging them accordingly.

However, what Amazon failed to disclose was the significant human involvement in this supposedly AI-driven process. It was later revealed that nearly 70% of the footage from the stores was manually checked by approximately 1000 employees based in India. (Nolan, 2024) This revelation raised questions about the authenticity of Amazon’s AI claims and highlighted the ethical issues related to underpaid labour in third-world countries.

This practice of AI washing is not exclusive to large, well-established companies. Smaller firms and startups have also been found guilty of making false and misleading statements about their use of AI. For instance, Delphia Inc. and Global Predictions Inc., both investment firms, were charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making such claims. They agreed to pay a combined $400,000 to settle these charges. (SEC, 2024)

These incidents serve as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and honesty in the tech industry, especially when it comes to the use of AI. Consumers and investors alike deserve to know the truth about the products and services they are buying or investing in. AI washing not only misleads them but also undermines the credibility of genuine AI innovations.

Moreover, these false AI use claims can have serious implications for workers in third-world countries who are often underpaid and overworked. It is crucial for companies to ensure fair labour practices and to acknowledge the human labour that often powers their so-called AI technologies.

In conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize various industries, it is essential for companies to be honest about their use of this technology. AI washing and false AI use claims not only mislead consumers and investors but also raise serious ethical concerns. As we continue to navigate the AI era, transparency, honesty, and ethical labour practices must be at the forefront.
