# Project Statement - Draft 001

## Project Overview

This project investigates the ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) by creating an interactive, engaging experience aimed at fostering critical discussions about AI morality. The final outcome is a multifaceted system that includes a digital quiz, printed forms, and a dynamic user interface, all designed to evaluate and reflect users' ethical stances on AI-related scenarios.

## Final Outcome

The core of this project is an interactive quiz that assesses users' ethical perspectives on AI. The quiz features carefully crafted questions that prompt users to consider various moral dilemmas involving AI, such as its rights, decision-making capabilities, and responsibilities towards humans. Upon completion, users receive an 'ethical personality' profile, represented visually by a unique digital aura. This profile is designed to spark conversations and encourage deeper thinking about the ethical dimensions of AI.

The printed form, an integral part of the project, allows users to engage with the content in a physical format. The form includes a series of questions accompanied by pros and cons, which users can mark to reflect their opinions. The forms are then scanned and processed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, ensuring seamless integration with the digital system. The use of ArUco markers ensures precise alignment and accurate data capture.

The user interface is designed to be both functional and visually appealing. It guides users through the quiz, displaying progress and providing feedback. The system uses computer vision to enhance user engagement by showing facial landmarks, creating an interactive and immersive experience. The final report, printed on thermal paper, balances a clinical and commercial aesthetic, effectively communicating the users' results.

## Process Overview

The project began with extensive research into AI ethics, focusing on how AI models are trained and the potential moral implications of their use. This phase involved reviewing existing AI tools, datasets like Microsoft's TOXIGEN, and exploring immoral/unfiltered AI models. Engaging with peers and tutors provided valuable feedback that shaped the project's direction.

The design process was iterative, involving multiple rounds of user testing and refinement. Initial prototypes of the quiz and printed forms were tested to gather feedback, leading to significant improvements in question design and user interface. The development of the printed form required a shift from digital to physical design considerations, emphasizing readability and user engagement.

A critical aspect of the project was integrating technology with user interaction. The use of OCR and ArUco markers ensured accurate data processing from the physical forms, while the digital interface provided real-time feedback and an engaging user experience. The design of the printed report aimed to present the results in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner, ensuring users could easily interpret their ethical profiles.

## Conclusion

This project successfully combines research, design, and technology to create an interactive experience that encourages critical thinking about AI ethics. The final outcome, an integrated system of digital and physical components, effectively communicates users' ethical perspectives and fosters meaningful discussions. This project not only highlights the importance of ethical considerations in AI development but also demonstrates the potential of interactive design to engage and educate users on complex moral issues.
