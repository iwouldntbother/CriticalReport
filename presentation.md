# Presentation

## Outline

1. What is your Research Question and how does your SD 02 project address it?

   - You can explain this using diagram(s) or using images of your work and written explanations. This Will demonstrate how your enquiry is informed by critical awareness of contexts, media and methods relevant to your practice.

2. Within which historical and/or contemporary contexts of Graphic Communication Design does your practice integrate?

   - Include annotated references, images, documentation.This will show you have critically analysed of a range of practical, theoretical and/or technical knowledge(s) specific to your enquiry.

3. How has experimentation supported the development your SD 02 project until now and what have you learned from this process?

   - Include documentation of your working process/es, experimentation, prototyping, iteration and refinement.This will show you are able to define your practice through an iterative and interrogative approach and are able to evaluate methods, experiments, results and their implications.â€”

4. How does the work you have produced for SD 02 (which is still a work-in-progress) implement media and messages?

   - Detail how you want your intended audience to engage with your work. Include documentation of the design decisions you have made and the refined design details you have applied in order for your work to communicate to them. This will show you are able to communicate effectively and with intent.

5. How has the work you have realised so far helped you to express and defend your creative and ethical position in relation to Graphic Communication Design?

   - Refer to your critical report and use images of your work and/or diagrams to help clarify your position. This will show the integration between your studio practice and writing in your portfolio of work.

6. What are your aims and ambitions for Unit 10 and what help do you need in order to achieve them?

   - For example: booking in to workshops, support with developing technical skills, help with developing your critical report, any other support you think you would benefit from.

### Slide 1

Question: "What moral issues stem from excessive integration of Artificial Intelligence into creative tools?"

For the project, I am using AI within a digital/physical project aimed to start the conversation into people's morality in relation to AI. The basis of the project is to allow people to assess their morals, in relation to AI. Though a physical form and digital AI analysis, the users will be given a comprehensive report outlining their moral stand towards AI use.

### Slide 2

Looking at formal, legal and political forms from entities such as the UK government, HMRC and statistical diagrams. Then using modern AI large language models to summarise a simple report on peoples inputs.

### Slide 3

This project has changed a fair bit from the initial idea, although the context hasn't. I have focused my initial experimentation into a more narrow and defined context. This means the project's scope is less broad and leads to a more fully flushed and refined output. Initially looking at challenging AI's morality as a form of exposure to the potential pitfalls of AI use. Instead I have refined the initial ideas to focus more on exploring how people feel towards AI as my research has shown this directly affects the development and utilisation of AI in the modern day.

### Slide 4

My work so far for SD 02 directly reports back to the user and does this with complete transparency, something that I have noted in my contextual report as a large factor in creating a more positive future for AI use. The use of both physical and digital mediums helps ground people and invites people of all ages to engage with my project.

### Slide 5

The project so far has really highlighted to me how my workflow is heavily based in the digital world, this has been somethingI have tried to challenge. Limiting the use of digital automation and project management and instead opting to use traditional physicals techniques such as mind-maps and post-it notes.

---

### Slide 6

At this point my project has been refined in a research-aided experimentation sense, however I believe that as I continue to create and refine, I will find more practical ways tyo experiment. User testing from this stage will be a large focus.
